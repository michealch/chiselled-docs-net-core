# Chiselled Ubuntu for .Net
**Project by Canonical and Microsoft**
## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the chiselled / chiseled Ubuntu image for .Net
## Literature Review
Before we learn about chiselled Ubuntu, we need to about Distroless Ubuntu and Chisel.

**Distroless Ubuntu**, inspired by Google's Distroless concept, is a minimalistic version of Ubuntu. Like Google's Distroless, it has no non-essential elements such as the package manager, bash, and non-essential packages.

[**Chisel**](https://github.com/canonical/chisel) is a software tool for carving and cutting Debian packages![^1]
It is built on the idea of **package slices** - minimal, complimentary and loosely coupled sets of files, based on the packageâ€™s metadata and content. Slices are basically subsets of the Debian packages, with their own content and set of dependencies to other internal and external slices.[^1]

**Chiselled Ubuntu for .NET** is a afford from canonical and Microsoft to build small, safe distroless image based on Ubuntu for .NET. It is similar to conventional [distroless](https://hackernoon.com/distroless-containers-hype-or-true-value-2rfl3wat), but based on Ubuntu and `.deb` packages sliced with chisel to optimize.
Pros: [^2]
1. No Shell.
2. No package manager.
3. Small in size (~100 MB Base image).
4. Non-root (app) User by default. (See following screenshot)
